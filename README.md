## I want to Contribute
The easiest way to get started is to join the [slack workspace](https://opensource.tophat.com/slack) and head to a project channel.

We have a list of projects on the [opensource portal](https://opensource.tophat.com), but you can always look through [github.com/tophat](https://github.com/tophat)


## Additional Resources
### Project Owners (And Responsibilties)
For the project owners and responsibilities see [project-owners-and-responsibilities](project-owners-and-responsibilities.md)

### Creating a new repository
You can clone the [new project starter](https://github.com/tophat/new-project-kit) and hit the ground running!


## Issue templates

Issue templates make the contributor experience infinitely better by providing structure for feature requests, bug reports and other issues that may need to be logged in a repository's issue tracker. You can create your own issue template easily by creating a `.github` directory containing a `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` subdirectory, in which you'll drop your Markdown templates that will be picked up by Github whenever someone tries to open an issue.

A generic issue template would look like this:

```markdown
---
name: My new issue type
about: This issue type is perfect for feature requests!

---

**Description**
A clear and concise description of what you are asking about.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. iOS]
 - Version: [e.g. 1.0]
 - Shell: [e.g. bash/sh/zsh/fish]
 - Node version: [e.g. v8.10.0], from `node --version`
 - ...


**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
```

Writing templates is as easy as creating a Markdown file in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder and pushing the changes up!

You can use the base templates for Feature requests and Bug reports present in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory present in the [new project starter kit](https://github.com/tophat/new-project-kit).
