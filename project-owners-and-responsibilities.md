# Responsibilities
As the owner, you are agreeing to take on the responsibilities in the following sub-sections. Feel free to delegate some of these responsibilities but the overall accountability lies with you, the owner.

If you are on vacation or cannot handle your responsibilities, you are responsible for delegating any affected tasks or roles to contributors or members who can take them on for the period. We want to support a community that will grow and help manage the project!

## Project 
- Go through the issue backlog once a week and ping the required developers if necessary
- Go through the PRs once a week to make sure they don't go stale
- Ensure new issues and PRs are responded to within 1 day
  - If this requires more time, even a simple "Hey! Thanks for contributing. We will check this out on Monday.", for example, would be good
- Drive a long term roadmap

## Community
- Participate and answer inquiries in the project Slack channel
- Encourage others to contribute and assist where required
- Ensure the project is easy to understand and therefore easier to contribute to
- Work towards a higher project maturity score

## Presence
- Work towards a higher project maturity score
- Actively grow the project presence
  - At least one public post every 4 months

## Leadership
- Attend a monthly open source leadership meeting (1 hour)
- Mentor others to contribute


# Benefits
- You work on something you are passionate about
